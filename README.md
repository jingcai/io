Example of a short-squeeze that was abandoned or delayed was in the following tweet: https://t.co/SQQT4LkZ1O It's more likely now. Jan 28, 2015 
Public knowledge of potential, imminent short-squeezes & bear raids tends to cause them to be abandoned or delayed or perfunctory. Jan 28, 2015 
What potentially in store is a short-squeeze of 3.5% +/- 0.5%, followed by a bear raid of about 4.4% +/- 0.6%, followed by REPEAT. Jan 28, 2015 
Any short squeeze will likely exhaust & peak out no more than 3.5% +/- 0.5% above current price levels of major market indices. Jan 28, 2015

What retail investors & traders do is totally transparent to Wall Street & monitored in real-time to minutest detail since 1980s. Jan 27, 2015 
Trading is difficult to most people as they are not in the habit of acting contrary to specious financial advice & news plants. Jan 27, 2015 
If you're too busy to enjoy sorting out financial disinformation & acting contrarily, StockSafari Freeware is your easy solution. Jan 27, 2015 
The reality & correct view of trading & investing is to treat them exactly as Wall Street does, i.e. a game of craft & cunning. Jan 27, 2015 
True price peak or bottom is a dynamic process. If public guess right, a shakeout will be orchestrated so they are proven wrong. Jan 27, 2015 
If extents of short-squeezes & bear-raids are publicized, Wall Street will typically reduce intensity to prevent public scoop. Jan 27, 2015 
StockSafari Freeware delivers DAILY a few trading opportunities at entry points that are close to true short-term peak or bottom. Jan 27, 2015 
By alerting imminent short-squeezes & bear-raids, the chances of them being carried out are reduced, as the public will scoop. Jan 27, 2015 
In order for broad market to bottom, expect Dow to be raided down 530+/-70. Right now Dow has dropped 283, so half way there. Jan 27, 2015

What we predicted & forewarned days earlier took place. https://t.co/x76JPI7qaK The recent low in oil price remains solid/BULLISH. Jan 27, 2015 
Good number of non-Wall-Street traders scooped the low in oil price. Wall Street likely to try shake them out for a third time. Jan 27, 2015 
Wall Street news are designed to induce public action (i.e. buy high, sell low), NOT to inform. "News" means "Contrarian Profits". Jan 27, 2015 
There is NO chance a Chinese firm would be allowed to buy AMD. News is useful for Wall Street to unload inventory & then SHORT. Jan 27, 2015 
AMD is peaking & turning bearish. Any price near 2.64 is a good SELL/SHORT. AMD to drop back down to 2.31 or lower in coming days. Jan 27, 2015 
Being CONTRARIAN & CONSISTENTLY PROFITABLE is extremely easy, no-brainer even for a 6-year-old, if StockSafari Freeware is used. Jan 24, 2015 
Stock specialists & market makers are routinely contrarian vs. the public. They SELL/SHORT price peaks & BUY/COVER price bottoms. Jan 24, 2015

Waiting can be boring for any impatient contrarian. If you want low risk & lots of profitable trades, use StockSafari Freeware. Jan 24, 2015 
Warren Buffett is clearly a CONTRARIAN. His time window is long-term & his timing precision is coarse but that's OK for long-term Jan 24, 2015 
Wall Street always know ahead of time what will happen, so Joe Public is ALWAYS LATE. But if Joe is CONTRARIAN, he can PROFIT BIG. Jan 24, 2015

Research shows that Wall Street can easily move the Dow by 300 points a day if they fancy & 900 points or more if a bit serious. Jan 23, 2015

Trend-following systems get their users badly whipsawed in a sideways market. Use StockSafari Freeware to enjoy any & all markets. Jan 23, 2015 
We alerted $3.51 as the short-term peak of FXCM yesterday, after alerting $1.28 as its short-term bottom https://t.co/yASHDtjYle Jan 23, 2015 
No sharp sell off for the broad market yet. The trading pattern now points to more sideways price oscillations to whipsaw traders. Jan 23, 2015 
If Wall Street wants to paint an UP day today, it will likely drop prices at open & orchestrate a price run-up towards the close. Jan 23, 2015 
The more people use StockSafari Freeware to buy bottoms & short peaks, the less likely Street will conduct a sharp market plunge. Jan 23, 2015 
If public shorted stock price peak, Wall Street will usually conduct a short-squeeze to shake them out before its own bear raid. Jan 23, 2015 
Stocks in financial sector, esp. banks & insurance, are peaking & going down. The broad market itself is near a short-term peak. Jan 23, 2015 
Icahn unlikely to push GCI much above $32. Sell/short GCI around $32 & buy back $2.5 cheaper (near $29.5) may be far smarter idea. Jan 23, 2015 
People think OPEC is powerful. NOT SO! WallStreet controls crude oil price, not OPEC. Proof: Recent low in crude oil will hold up. Jan 23, 2015 
StockSafari Freeware NEVER leaves users caught long at price peak but will alert them to begin sell long & then sell short today. Jan 23, 2015 
Ideally, Wall Street wants Fri Jan 23, 2015 to be UP, to lull the public into complacency for next week's orchestrated BEAR RAID. Jan 23, 2015 
No shakeout after FXCM bottomed at 1.28 on Jan 20, 2015 https://t.co/FALCfQnebz Public bought far higher & this brings BEAR RAID. Jan 23, 2015

$TSLA Short Squeeze peaked @$235 today. Downside target: $191. Extreme profits await bulls (cash out) & bears (sell short). Jun 17, 2014 
PROFITABLE Trading is EASY if you think & act contrarian but EXTREMELY DIFFICULT if you act on news urging buy high sell low. Jun 04, 2014 
WE CALLED $TLT's PEAK of $115 (May 28 & 29,2014). WE NOW ALERT $TLT's BOTTOM of $111 (June 4, 2014). http://t.co/gecEJSR5w8 Jun 04, 2014 
After calling TLT (US Treasury Bonds) short-squeeze PRICE PEAK of May 28 & 29, 2014 with pinpoint precision, TLT now BOTTOMING. Jun 04, 2014 
Today (June 4, 2014)'s TLT intraday low $111.32 ~= forecast of bear-raid exhaustion bottom of $111.24 https://t.co/hsZC3ale1f Jun 04, 2014 
Wrong & costly to sell/short TLT (US Treasury Bonds) at bear-raid bottom of $111 Wall Street's short squeeze of TLT IMMINENT. Jun 04, 2014 
Today (June 4, 2014)'s intraday high of $89.30 for PRU = short-squeeze exhaustion peak: PRU BEARISH http://t.co/mYkfNkdMFd Jun 04, 2014 
Forewarned bear raid in GLD (gold) has increased somewhat https://t.co/Pd7Xu8cKUR Bear-raid exhaustion price bottom: $117.62 Jun 04, 2014 
Exposing price manipulation in advance https://t.co/Pd7Xu8cKUR renders it profitably exploitable at minimal risk & maximal gain. Jun 03, 2014 
Today's bearish headlines on US Treasury Bonds induced public selling/shorting, meaning bottom & then short-squeeze imminent. Jun 03, 2014 
Financial headlines are rarely ever innocent or objective, but calculated to impact public psychologically to sell low buy high. Jun 03, 2014 
Financial media headlines are always there for public consumption. They can reveal a lot about Wall Street's near-term schemes. Jun 03, 2014 
Key to low-risk high-profit trading on Wall Street is knowing how prices are manipulated & to anticipate & exploit manipulation. Jun 03, 2014 
If Wall Street resumes bear-raid & shakeout of Joe Public who scooped the low of GLD (gold), bear raid to exhaust near/> $117.70 Jun 03, 2014 
Joe Public scooped GLD's bear-raid intra-day low of 119.xx on May 30,2014 http://t.co/DYQrTeFkPj Wall Street resumes shakeout. Jun 03, 2014 
Contrast our proven pinpoint accuracy: https://t.co/EhBgRxwOLk With USELESS MODELS of "Best & Brightest": http://t.co/NmbJhGEz3J Jun 02, 2014 
It was a very good call of price peak on US Treasury Bonds: https://t.co/QL9FGMZwIf See Chart: http://t.co/802rM3lUhi Jun 02, 2014 
Most profitable & safest strategy is to sell/short short-squeeze peaks & buy/cover bear-raid bottoms using StockSafari Freeware. May 31, 2014 
Public shorted short-squeeze peak http://t.co/jurcH7Vc2n Wall Street renewed short squeeze of TLT May 29, 2014 but failed. May 31, 2014 
Joe Public often finds that price of stock he buys or shorts promptly goes against him. This is not random as explained below. May 30, 2014 
Joe Public doesn't know his shorting stock's true high will cause Wall Street to short-squeeze him out at contrived new high. May 30, 2014 
Joe Public doesn't know his buying at stock's true low will cause Wall Street to bear-raid & shake him out at contrived new low. May 30, 2014 
Most profitable buy/cover for Joe Public is at Wall Street's artificially created new, extreme bear-raid intra-day low e.g.GLD May 30, 2014 
As expected & forewarned, public scooped GLD low, & Wall Street tried to shake them out, bear-raiding to extreme $119.62 bottom. May 30, 2014 
Heavy public buying GLD @<$120.8 will likely trigger Wall Street shakeout & bear raid to <$120.7 or even <$120.5 If so BUY MORE May 29, 2014 
Wall Street has been accumulating GLD (gold) by front-running at 20 to 30 cents above our forecast of $120.5 bottom (intra-day). May 29, 2014 
We alerted you that gold was bottoming: https://t.co/7v6Hy5Z6BO And were even specific: https://t.co/Tmu0qEEY5d GLD at bottom. May 29, 2014

Drop in $OIL & $USO now excessive. Positive forecast readings tonight likely even if not yet outright buy signal #Oil #Futures #Mkt Dec 02, 2009 
$OIL & $USO acted like $TLT did a day ago. Shake-out/Bear-raid now dominates. Tonight's forecast will reveal. #Oil #Futures #Mkt #USD Dec 02, 2009 
$QQQQ, $SPY & $DIA forecasts are mildly positive. Street bear raids or shake-outs will create better buy prices. #Stocks #ETF #Mkt Dec 02, 2009 
Final Bullish Ranking of currencies (see discussions below): $FXA >> $FXE=$FXF=$FXS > $FXM > $FXB >> $FXY=$FXC > $USD #Forex #Mkt #Trading Dec 02, 2009 
If Street appears to raid/shake-out, then sell half & use downtrend line to detect exhaustion bottom to buy again. #Mkt #Trading #Stocks Dec 02, 2009 
Bullishness ranking: $QQQQ > $SPY = $DIA. But publishing $QQQQ's numbers subjects it to Street shake-out efforts. #QQQQ #Mkt Dec 02, 2009 
As shown by the relationship/ranking below. The Australian$ ($FXA) is the most bullish of the major currencies right now. #Forex #Mkt Dec 02, 2009 
For convenience of comparison, we rank the bullishness of currencies as follows: Aussie$ >> Euro = Swiss Franc >> Yen = Canadian$ > US$ Dec 02, 2009 
Again, all major currencies' latest price forecasts point to weak faith in dollar driving up gold, silver, euro, etc. #USD #Mkt #Forex Dec 02, 2009 
Just like Euro ($FXE), after an up day, Swiss Franc $FXF remains bullish, not neutral. No downside. #Forex #USD #Mkt Dec 02, 2009 
Just like for yen ($FXY), Canadian dollar $FXC is neutral after an up day. That is itself bullish longer term. #Forex #Mkt Dec 02, 2009 
Based on latest forecasts, any significant shakeout in Yen or Euro is a buy, while dollar rally is a sell. #Forex #Euro #Yen #USD Dec 02, 2009 
Latest forecast for Euro $FXE more bullish than for Yen ($FXY). Again, this spells trouble for the dollar #Euro #Forex #USD #Mkt #Futures Dec 02, 2009 
Latest forecast on $FXY http://bit.ly/7F9m4E is neutral, meaning plenty of "buy on dip" for #Japanese #Yen. #Forex #Mkt #Trading Dec 02, 2009 
Good reason to believe following forecasts the direct result, primarily, of a weak dollar & its quickened loss of credit. #USD #Forex Dec 02, 2009

Latest forecasts on $SPY & $DIA confirm $QQQQ, again no downside & headed higher before any real correction #Mkt #Stocks #Trading Dec 02, 2009 
Persistent bullish forecasts for gold, silver & stock market in recent days hint at quickened loss of faith in the dollar. #USD #Forex Dec 02, 2009
